# AWS Portfolio Projects

This repository showcases a collection of AWS projects built with Python, demonstrating how to integrate multiple AWS services for real-world solutions. The projects include:

- **AWS Lambda Functions:** Serverless data processing (e.g., Mars Rover photos, UFC data ETL).
- **Amazon S3 Integration:** Scalable storage for datasets and files.
- **Amazon Redshift:** ETL pipelines and data warehousing.
- **API Integration:** Fetching and processing data from external APIs.

## Getting Started

1. **Explore Projects:** Each directory contains its own setup instructions and deployment scripts.
2. **Deploy:** Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to deploy Lambda functions and configure services.
3. **Test:** Utilize provided test events and scripts to validate your setup.

/Lambda_HTTP_UFC_ETL
    Contains the code, configuration files, and deployment scripts for the UFC ETL pipeline using AWS Lambda.

/Mars_Rovers_Lambda
    Houses the AWS Lambda function code and configuration for fetching and processing Mars Rover photos, along with integration details for Amazon S3.

/container_lambda_deployment_osi_image
    Contains the Dockerfile, application code (e.g., app.py, bootstrap.py, requirements.txt), and deployment instructions for packaging an AWS Lambda function in a Docker container using a custom OS image.



Happy building with AWS!
